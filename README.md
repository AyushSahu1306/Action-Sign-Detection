# Action-Sign-Detection

## Action Sign Recognition with YOLOv10
This project focuses on detecting and classifying various action signs using the YOLOv10 architecture. The dataset contains images of action signs, which have been enhanced through extensive data augmentation techniques such as flipping, brightness adjustments, and rotations. The model is trained using the YOLOv10n variant.
